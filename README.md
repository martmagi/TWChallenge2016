# Doggify
Android application to help individuals better manage their finances. 

The application was made at TransferWise Hackathon 2.2 by Risto Pärnapuu, Reino Zuppur, Anna Bilmaijer, Karl Valliste and Mart Mägi.

User has to enable SEB notifications so that whenever they make a purchase, they get an email about it. Doggify reads the e-mail and prompts the user whether the purchase was useful or not. 
At the end of the day, the user can see an overview of their purchases by day, week or month and make lifestyle changes accordingly. :)
